# wordsearch.c

A short C program that solves a word search.

## Usage

The first command-line argument specifies the file containing the word search. The second argument specifies the word to be searched for.

The word search should be in a format like this:

    GDLWT
    ADOJG
    JLVGE
    UTYXS

Just a txt file with line breaks.

If the word is found it will be printed out like this:

    -D---
    --O--
    ---G-
    ----S

When searching for a word, case is ignored.
